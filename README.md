This script utilizes the sqlite3 module to connect to an SQLite database named database.db and retrieve information about the table structure. It then uses the fpdf library to create a PDF document. The script extracts the table schema (column names) and all rows from the ips table, then populates the PDF document with this data.

Ensure that you have the SQLite database database.db with the appropriate schema and data.

Install the required dependencies using pip:

``pip install fpdf``

Ensure that the database.db file exists in the same directory as the script and adjust the table name (ips) and column names as needed to match your database schema.
